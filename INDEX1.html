                    <h3>
                        Hey, buddy. It’s been 3 years already since I held your head in my hands with tears streaming down my face while I watched you take your last breaths. <br><br>
                        Sometimes it feels like a dream, but I don’t know what kind. Half the time it’s like I’m in the middle of a bad dream, but maybe I’ll wake up and see you at the foot of my bed. Or maybe I’ll look over right now and see you lying by my chair when you’d always be when I was just gaming on my computer.<br><br>
                        Sometimes it feels like you were just a dream. I want to fall asleep again and hope that I restart that same dream. Was it really 13 years ago that I first saw you? When dad brought you home? I still wanted to have another 2 or 3, or even 5 years to hang out with you, or was that all just a happy dream? Everyday when I go home or walk around the house, I always feel like there is something missing. And it hits me at random times through the day.<br><br>
                        I never once thought you would leave such a hole in my heart that I couldn’t even sleep once you left. Anyway, I hope you're happy wherever you are. I hope you’re taking naps and eating enough of your favorite treats for the both of us. I’m trying my hardest to deal and get through life without you, and it gets easier everyday, but that doesn’t mean that I miss you and love you any less. I was only 6 when you first came home, and now I’m 19, I feel like we grew up together. You are the first dog I raised from puppyhood to an adult. I hope you know how much I love and miss you. I am eternally grateful that I got to have you as my dog, or even as a part of the family because you were the best family dog that no other dogs will ever replace you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your loving hooman,<br>
